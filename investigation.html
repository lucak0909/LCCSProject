        I began my project by researching the different aspects of health and wellbeing that affect people’s 
        lives that I could create a project from. To do this I brainstormed (right) these aspects and viable 
        project ideas that could be derived from them. I also conducted short surveys within my 
        class using a diverse demographic. The surveys focused on students, to investigate the health 
        and wellness needs of young people today.

    <br>Between each survey I observed the result and formulated 
    the next survey based on this result.<br><br><b>Survey Results:</b>
    <div style="display: block;">
      <img src="Images/Q1.png" alt="Results Of First Survey" class="surveyimg" style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 5px; width: 20%;">

    From this data I was able to determine the primary needs of end-users and the "pre-existing solutions" to those needs.  <br><br>
    According to mentalhealth.org.uk, "60% of young people (aged 18 to 24) have felt so stressed by the 
    pressure to succeed that they have felt overwhelmed or unable to cope." This statistic is reflected 
    well through my surveys, therefore, I decided that my project would be based on the topic of stress. <br><br>
    After determining my project's theme, I conducted research on the previously mentioned "pre-existing 
    solutions" and attempted to find a flaw universally within these solutions.  
    <div>
      <img src="Images/table 1.png" alt="pre-existing solutions" class="center" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    </div>
      Each pre-existing solution had its own positives and negatives with one crucial 
      flaw shared between them. Not one of these brands had a system in place to both monitor <u>and</u> reduce stress. <br><br>
      It was clear that the end user’s primary need was a device which could do both while also being 
      easily portable and user-friendly. Subsequently, I decided that for my LCCS project I would attempt
      to create such a prototype. I began researching into how the watches monitor stress with the intention 
      of replicating it. I found that the primary means to measure stress is the variability of the user's heart rate 
      (aka. The rate of change/slope of the user's heart rate). These watches use a pulse sensor to determine the user's heart rate and subsequently 
      their stress-levels. According to the National Library of Medicine (US), pulse sensors work based on "photoplethysmography" 
      (PPG). PPG works by shining green light into a skin and measuring the blood circulation of the person, based on the amount of light reflected 
      into a photodetector (LDR). This is due to hemoglobin's ability to absorb light, especially green light.
