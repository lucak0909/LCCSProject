            During the creation of my artefact, an attempt was made to reduce memory usage on the MicroBit device 
            due to the fatal error caused when it had reached its limit of 16kB. I attempted this first by implementing a 
            function to clear the "pulse_list" after calculating an average. I hoped for a RAM usage of less than 
            16kB, but the actual result showed usage greater than 16kB in the form of the fatal error. I then tried 
            again by instead increasing the frequency of clearing the "pulse_list," yet it also resulted in RAM 
            usage exceeding 16kB, leading to failure. Finally, I added a delay into my microbit code. This 
            would make my data less accurate as it would collect less values but successfully decreased memory usage by writing to the memory less.<br><br>

          <li>
            Another case of testing was when attempts were made to recognize a button press on the MicroBit while
            receiving BPM through serial data. For my solution I created code in the MicroBit which sent data,
            out of the range of any other serial data being sent, on press of any button. Unfortunately, the expected
            Python output was not attained upon button press. I then attempted to place the serial write line inside of 
            a loop to increase the length of time that the programme could read that a button was pressed.
            Finally, the programme successfully recognized a button press while 
            receiving BPM through serial data by looping the serial write line 150 times, on the
            press of a button, achieving the expected Python output. <br><br>

      <h2><u><b>A Problem I Encountered:</b></u></h2>
      <div>
        The most difficult problem I encountered during implementation was programming the MicroBit to recognize a heartbeat.
        My only means of measuring the user's heart rate was by using the pulse sensor to count the amount of beats per minute.
        Originally I planned to recognize a heartbeat by setting a threshold at which if the pulse sensor's output passes, 
        the MicroBit would recognize it as a beat. The pulse sensor gave an analogue output within a range of 0 - 1023, however,
        the average output value deviated often. This is due to multiple factors, however the primary 
        cause I had observed was that since the pulse sensor operates by measuring the amount of light not absorbed by the user's
        haemoglobin, if there was any significant movement by the user the pulse sensor would move with them potentially
        shining the light on a larger/smaller blood vessel containing more/less haemoglobin resulting in a larger or smaller 
        output range from the pulse sensor. This meant that the original method that I used to ensure the MicroBit recognized a 
        heartbeat would not work. <br><br>

        This was the solution I came to; Every second, 
        the pulse sensor sent roughly 50 outputs, so I attempted to utilized fast frequency in my solution. Each time the MicroBit 
        read a value given by the pulse sensor, it would add said value to the end of a list called "pulse_list". Then, every 2 
        seconds, the MicroBit would loop through "pulse_list" and add each index in pulse list to a variable called "Average". Then 
        once all values in "pulse_list" were added to "Average", I divided "Average" by the length of "pulse_list". I then emptied 
        "pulse_list" and for the next 2 seconds, if the pulse sensor output went from being less than "Average" to greater than "Average", 
        the MicroBit would recognize it as a heartbeat. After 2 more seconds the same process would occur, ensuring that even if the 
        pulse sensor's output range changed drastically, within 2 seconds the MicroBit would be able to recognize the user's heartbeat.<br><br>

        The below is the code and an image of the serial plotter to better understand the solution:

      <h2><u><b><br>An Important Piece of my Code:</b></u></h2>
      <div style="float: left;"><img src="Images/Important.png" alt="Serial Function" style="height: 400px; width: auto;"></div>
      <div style="max-width: 90%;">
        This piece of code was vitally important to the functioning of my project. The purpose of this function was to clean and 
        validate any serial data received by the python programme. The entire project hinged on receiving value for heart rate 
        from the MicroBit. This code ensured this by first initializing the data variable as a alphabetical string.
        This was to ensure that the programme entered the while loop when the function "checkBPM()" was called, 
        as "str.isdigit()" returns False if the string is not only numerical digits.  <br>

        <img src="Images/validate.png" alt="While Loop to validate data" style="display: inline-block; width: 50%; margin-left: 10%; padding: 5px;">

        <br>The loop then initializes the serial connection, then reads the received serial data. The serial data is 
        received in a unpleasant format with many unwanted characters littered throughout.
        The function "str.replace()" resolves that issue by replacing any character with another.<br><br>

        <img src="Images/cleaning.png" alt="Cleaning Serial Data" style="display: inline-block; width: 20%; margin-left: 20%; padding-bottom: 20px;">

        <br>The loop then closes the serial connection. Finally, if the string "data" is not solely 
        numerical digits or is equal to "0" (to ensure NaN values are not accepted), the function returns the 
        variable "data" to the main programme to be used as heart rate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
